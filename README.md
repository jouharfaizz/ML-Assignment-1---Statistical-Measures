Objectives

Perform Basic EDA (Score: 1):

Summarize the dataset (shape, info, descriptive statistics).

Identify missing values, data types, and duplicate entries.

Outlier Detection and Removal (Score: 4):

Use the following methods to detect and handle outliers:

Mean and Standard Deviation

Percentile Method (5th and 95th percentiles)

Interquartile Range (IQR)

Z-Score Method

Apply methods like trimming, capping, or imputation using mean/median to address outliers.

Compare Outlier Removal Methods (Score: 1):

Create a box plot for each method to visualize the effectiveness of outlier removal.

Normality Check and Transformation (Score: 1):

Check the normality of the price per sqft column using a histogram.

Perform transformations if necessary.

Analyze skewness and kurtosis before and after the transformation.

Correlation Analysis (Score: 1):

Compute correlation between numerical columns.

Visualize correlations using a heatmap.

Scatter Plot Visualization (Score: 1):

Create scatter plots to examine relationships between key variables.

Timely Submission (Score: 1):

Ensure all tasks are completed and submitted within the given timeframe.

Steps to Execute the Project

Load the dataset and perform basic exploratory data analysis.

Identify and handle missing values and duplicates.

Use the four outlier detection methods to clean the data.

Compare the effectiveness of outlier removal techniques using box plots.

Examine the normality of the price per sqft column and apply transformations if necessary.

Calculate and visualize correlations using a heatmap and scatter plots.

Document all findings and visualizations.

Requirements

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

Software: Python (Jupyter Notebook recommended)
